# Deterministic-Optimisation-Algorithms
An example of two optimisation algorithms (conjugate gradient and levenberg marquardt) applied to the rosenbrook function.

Both algorithms start at the same initial point `(-1.5, -1)` and exit when the solution converges to an error smaller than `1e-8`. 

Compile all the files easily with `make all` and then run them with `make run`. You can also compile the files individually with `make cgd` or `make lm`.
